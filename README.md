## talhelper configuration files

`talhelper` is a tool that helps creating Talos configuration files declaratively.

The main motivation to use `talhelper` instead of the `talosctl gen config` command when generating Talos machineconfig files is wanting to have the machineconfigs files version controlled in a Git repository. 

Currently `talosctl` does not offer that option.
