## Talhelper configuration files

`Talhelper` is a tool that helps creating Talos Linux configuration files declaratively.

The main motivation to use `Talhelper` instead of the `talosctl gen config` command when generating Talos Linux machine config files is wanting to have the machine config files version controlled in a Git repository. 

Currently `talosctl` does not offer that option.
